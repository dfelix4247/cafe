I love this place so much! Delicious coffee and funny girls. They are very friendly and welcoming,"Jun 12, 2025"
"Super friendly staff, great service, I love the whole "" read chismes "" while you drink your coffee . Of course I put in my own chisme . I had the coffee cake , and iced white cocoa coffee.

They were dog friendly, they gave my dog a puppachino and water .

Great experience, would definitely come again.","Jun 28, 2025"
"Coffee & Chisme is a cute hole in the wall that is a flair of Latin culture and trendy concepts! We were a little hesitant about the ""B"" rating, but did our due justice and looked around and didnt see anything out of place. So be weary. If you wanna just come for the chisme, they have some seating outside with the bowls and seating inside as well! We weren't planning to stay long, but couldn't resisit! They have post it notes that that you can also write on and leave your own!
We got the cocoa puffs cereral drink, the lavender lemonade, cupcakes: red velvet, chocolate, & carrot cake, blueberry scones (i liked it, but cousin thought it was a bit dry) and a coffee cake.
All in al, service was fast, not a lot of seating, but if youre coming in with a small group. You can find a spot.
Plenty of street parking (check signs in case of street sweeping).
Also, no AC, so beware if going in the summer.

All in all, a cute place to stop by.","Jun 3, 2025"
"The concept is amazing, the jar of Chisme and the environment is great.
Iced Cafe de Olla was delicious, it's my go to. I've also gotten the affogato since they serve Thirfty ice cream!
The crepes are good, just have to be patient when ordering food made to order. Limited parking but a fun spot if you have the time and want to support a small business.","May 7, 2025"
"This café has great service overall! The staff are friendly, bilingual (English and Spanish) and it feels familiar. Also, the food smells great. I had a bagel with cream cheese that I enjoyed.

However, I ordered an ice vanilla latte with oat milk, and it was entirely too sweet. They were so kind to remake the drink without any syrup, but the espresso itself tasted burnt and undrinkable. I think that they have the potential to be an amazing coffee shop if they're able to hone in on the espresso. If you like sweet coffee and coffee dessert drinks then this spot might be for you.

Street parking is available around the café.","Mar 25, 2025"
"The service was great. Diego rang us up and was pleasant to be helped by. I had a difficult time choosing between 2 items and Diego helped pick one that ended up being exactly what I needed to please my coffee itch.

Customer service from Diego and the other caffee barista girl were great. They are extremely hardworking being that there were a lot of people and the only two working that day. With the amount of people, the number of drinks and food items they had to make was incredible to watch. Best part was that this didnt affect how long my drinks were going to take because they arrived sooner than expected.

The pastries looked SO GOOD! I tried the blueberry scone and it was warm and soft in the center. I preferred it that was then how they are traditionally.
The service was EXCELLENT!
The interior looked CLEAN!
Coffee was AWESOME!
The Chisme was JUICY!
Prices are very FAIR!
I hope you get a chance to try them out!","Mar 23, 2025"
"$8 for a latte that taste like hot water is crazy.
Really unfortunate Was curious to support this business but will definitely not return","Jun 6, 2025"
"A place where you feel right at home!

Enjoyed the place and the decor! Came here on a Tuesday afternoon and it wasn't too busy.

Ordered their strawberry matcha, which I rate a 7/10. It was delicious.

My brother ordered their Abuelita Frappé. He rated it a 7.5/10.

We also got one of their pastries--the banana muffin! Rate: 8/10. Super tasty, and even tastier warmed up!

Overall, I loved my experience here! The homey greeting was amazing.

Coming back for sure to try their Café de Olla Cold Foam!","Feb 28, 2025"
"Nice little spot in South Gate. We need more places like this one. The iced code de olla was a lot better than expected. The sweetness was just right (not too sweet!). Also had an oatmeal and it was okay (bit too watery, but still good). I enjoyed these two things while reading some good chisme. And the service was great. Got my items pretty quickly.","Apr 19, 2025"
"This place is so cute! The señoras working behind the counter are providing warm and welcoming hospitality. Proud of them for learning the ins and outs of coffee & coffee culture! They had coffee knowledge and were very pleasant. They brought my coffee & pastry to me from behind the counter. They really made this a memorable experience.

This coffee shop is located in the city of South Gate, this is not a suburban area, it's a very overpopulated neighborhood with limited parking, street parking is your best bet! Complain all you want, this is a fairly new concept to this area. They are doing a fantastic job.

The menu is pretty extensive--I had a hard time deciding what I wanted. I ordered the iced Cafe De Olla with cold foam. I do wish the coffee was stronger and less sweet but the cold from was tasty. I'd get it again with a shot of espresso. I also ordered the coffee cake & it was great, not too sweet, perfectly warm & spongy. Loved it! The prices here are super affordable. Definitely worth it.

The chime jar is such a vibe I love the concept. When I walked in a few teenagers were writing down their chisme and we all laughed at reading some of other folks chisme. Overall a great experience I really appreciate what they are doing here! I'll be back!","Jan 3, 2025"
"The concept is great! Loved the anonymous chimes in the bowl! Such a conversation starter and crazy stories shared. There was a bit of a line but went fast and we revived our orders fast too. Most of the coffees we tried were good with the exception of a hot americano, it wasn't too strong. We sat outside and it was a good environment. Would go back!","Jun 7, 2025"
"Everything was amazing. The chisme was good. Staff very friendly! Food was good. I had chipotle chicken panini, just wish it was a bit more spicy but that's just me :P. Would 10/10 recommend this place and will for sure come back! Small but really nice place.","Jun 27, 2025"
"Wash doing laundry down the street and while I waited for my clothes to try I stopped by here. The parking is quite confusing so we ended up parking by the high school around the corner. If it were during school hours, we definitely wouldn't have found parking.

We were immediately greeted as soon as we walked in! We needed a few minutes to decide what to order so the barista told us to ding the bell whenever we were ready which was pretty cool.

Once our order was placed, we waited about 30 minutes before we got our drinks and pizza panini. There were already two guests who were waiting for their order to be done. So, we were right behind them. They seemed pretty staff so I'm not really sure why it took so long.

The people who were there already had their drinks and food. They only had a few seats and they were already taken, and the store was pretty small so we were an inconvenience to anyone else waiting for their order or trying to order.

Everything was good and made to order and worth the wait however i recommend placing an order online if you do decide to stop by.","Sep 29, 2024"
Delicious coffee! Coco puffs coffee is way better than what you get anywhere else!! And amazing price point,"Jun 15, 2025"
"The service and ambience is welcoming and warm. You're greeted immediately with a smile. The cafe de olla is so good, pictured has the cold foam. The ham and cheese sandwich was a little heavy but they have a great chipotle sauce that compliments everything well. Go put your chisme in the jar!","Feb 2, 2025"
The service and environment were good. Staff were friendly. We got the horchata frappe & chocolate abuelita latte. The horchata frappe was too sweet. We recommend to the chocolate abuelita latte. Highly recommend!,"May 8, 2025"
Loved the friendly staff and my coffee it was so good!!! I loved the cafe de olla. I also had a chipotle chicken sandwich and it was great. I don't really like spicy and it wasn't but had lots of flavor. Definitely a great place to come with your girlfriends and hangout,"Mar 29, 2025"
"Love the cafe de olla here but in the past two weeks I have ordered it two times and both times it has tasted really watered down. Not sure if there is a different person that is brewing it. I would love for it to taste how it used to, i'll give it another try in a few weeks.","May 15, 2025"
"This coffee shop is amazing. Everything that we ordered was delicious. We ordered drinks, pastries, and sandwiches and everything tasted delicious. The service was great. The lady who took our order was super friendly and kind and make sure that we were enjoying our food once it was served. I love the decoration. I took more pictures of the decoration than the food, but I will definitely be going back for more and I'll remember to take pictures of the food next time.","Feb 20, 2025"
"I ordered an Oreo and caramel frappe. My parents enjoyed them very much. The staff are very nice and attentive as well.

Parking in the area is a little tough but doable. Inside there is not much seating as it's pretty small but it's a really cute and clean.

The chisme bowls are too funny! I spent a good while reading them as I waited for my drinks. It seems they get a good flow of customers as well so there was a bit of a wait but I'll definitely be back!!","Apr 4, 2025"
"I was recently assigned to work in South Gate after a 3 year hiatus. Whether or not this is going to be a permanent gig doesn't matter since I have Coffee and Chisme to keep me company.

This particular part of State Street doesn't have a Starbucks or Tierra Mia nearby. I was craving my go-to Horchata Frappe that I get at Tierra Mia, but my car was plugged in and charging and I didn't want to go through the hassle of using some electrons in the middle of my charge.

Street parking is tight, but if you work nearby, like me, it's a just a quick walk. The place is small, to be sure, but it's chill with a good vibe. There's one main counter that has a Thrifty Ice cream display that greets you when you walk in. There's some lounge seating elevated right up in front, along with a couple of tables and some bar stools if you want to eat, drink, work of gossip (chisme).

The lady running the place is really sweet and prefers to speak Spanish, but she can easily accommodate English speakers. The menu is extensive with cold and hot drinks, various sandwiches and panini's, and desserts.

The Horchata Frappe was delicious. On par, if not better than Tierra Mia. The straw, though, is way too small and often gets clogged. I had to wait for my drink to thaw a little before I could really enjoy it. If they used bigger straws, like at Starbucks, I'm sure I would have had the full frappe experience.

The sausage, bacon and egg muffin was a surprise! It was just delicious. I got mine with Swiss cheese and regular mayo. The muffin really is an English muffin, not a sweet muffin. Unlike Starbucks, it wasn't a frozen sandwich heated in an air fryer. The muffin here was toasted with butter (you could taste the butteriness in the bread) with a wonderful crunch. The sausage and bacon was not remarkable, but the scrambled eggs were really fluffy and the combination of melted Swiss and mayo added a velvety smoothness I've never had in a sandwich.

I love supporting small businesses and the small upcharge compared to going to a larger chain is outweighed by the deliciousness of the drinks and food. I can't wait to try their other offerings, especially the Thrifty Ice Cream, on my next break.

For an out of the way, hole in the wall coffee shop in a part of South Gate that needs a change of coffee pace, Coffee and Chisme is a refreshing and delicious alternative to the big chains.

And that is no chisme...","Mar 18, 2024"
"Located in a questionable area but have it the benefit of the doubt bc of the higher ratings but was let down - hard. Super friendly workers - very nice and sweet but that's where it ends. The decor is trying and has a nook facing the window, greenery and some neon lights. Bathroom doesn't have a working sink - had it wrapped in a trash bag. No makeshift sink anywhere to wash hands so that's a red flag.

Now for the drinks - absolutely gross and no coffee detected. I could tell by the colors I was going to be disappointed and sure enough straight to the trash. I got a coco puff iced coffee and it was like sweet water. The horchata frappe was ice and milk. No espresso used at all.

$14 for 2 trash drinks is the low of the weekend.","Sep 15, 2024"
The matcha blended drink I got was awesome! Good taste. Great customer service. Just wish they had stevia.,"Apr 22, 2025"
"Banana muffin was super good!!
Our other pastry items were super hard to bite on :(. Out lattes tasted like cold brew no syrup/flavoring other than the cereal topping. Horchata frappe was too sweet to drink. So sad because we came from a few hours away","Aug 23, 2024"
Great! Drinks were good. I got the abuelita frappe and my bf got the cafe de olla coffee and both were good. I got a ham sandwich that tasted great and we shared a scone. Best part was the chisme such good chisme out there!,"May 4, 2025"
"I really wanted to love Coffee and Chisme, but honestly, it should be called Milk and Chisme. I was excited to try a new local spot, but unfortunately, our coffees tasted like straight-up milk with a splash of creamer--zero coffee flavor.

To top it off, the ordering process was frustrating. The lady taking our order asked us about five times what we wanted, yet still managed to get it wrong. Not exactly the smooth experience I was hoping for.

Hate to say it, but I won't be coming back. Plenty of other great coffee spots around that actually taste like coffee.","Mar 14, 2025"
We waited over an hour for 2 chicken paninis and 4 drinks on a Sunday afternoon. They got our order wrong about 2 times until they finally got it right. It was hectic that day. The chicken paninis were good and the drinks ok.,"Apr 12, 2025"
"Have stopped by a few times and love every drink I've tried, from the cafe de olla to their lattes. I have yet to try baked goods and food. Will definitely be coming back to try other drinks. Their staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. This place is a little hidden gem, very cute decor.","Jan 7, 2025"
"Nice little cozy place. They have really cute decor that goes with their business name. If you need a place to work or study or even just catching up with friends then this is a great spot. They also had a few books on display.

I ordered an abuelita frappe and it was delicious. It tasted just like the abuelita hot chocolate. Their selection of drinks is wide so you are bound to find something you like. Their hot drinks selection is also big.
Staff was super friendly and nice and I love that this is a family opened business so we did see the mom working with her kids and it was so cute to see that.","Jun 3, 2024"
Went in today menu isn't updated they charge you the updated price without telling you prices change. Got the cinnamon latee with oat milk lady who made is put 2% milk when I told her she said she didn't when I seen her with my own eyes making the drink also got the ice coffee float which has no flavor it taste water down no added flavor just the scoop of ice cream. very disappointing!!!,"Apr 18, 2025"
"Their drinks don't taste like coffee., go there if you want to drink sugar! I tried the abuelita ice latte it was disgusting. 1 sip and straight to the trash","Mar 8, 2025"
"Found this place through a quick search while in the area early for an event. The name is as cute as the space's aesthetic -- a mix of garden and modern minimalist design. It's quite small with limited seating so might not be the best for those looking for a work space or outdoor seating (there weren't any the day I came and not sure it has the capacity for it). The staff is friendly and welcoming, and the service is great. They seem to be quite busy with pick up orders because it was nonstop and our two drinks took a bit of time. My friend ordered the coco puff mocha and I ordered a caramel latte. I didn't try to cocoa puff drink (though it looked amazing and my friend said she liked it) but my caramel latte was not that great. I actually couldn't finish it or go beyond a few sips and it was the syrup used. The caramel tasted pretty artificial so not for me. I would love to try the place again and go for another drink, maybe like a flat white to assess espresso flavor. But all in all, it's a really nice space and worth visiting in the area.","Dec 6, 2024"
"Recently started coming here and now I'm obsessed. The cafe de olla with cold foam is my go to.The waffles are pretty good and their chicken panini is amazing!!! It's a cute place where you can kick back, grab a coffee and read some chismes The workers are pretty friendly as well.","Apr 11, 2025"
Amazing taste I love it and is my first time here great service amazing chismes to read,"Apr 24, 2025"
"I so much love this coffee place! I love the lavender coffee is my favorite and the sandwich is feels so much like home! The service is very good and friendly, bathroom is clean always. I always feel welcome and comfortable at any of their tables or chairs.","Mar 31, 2025"
Service was horrible! After waiting for 23 minutes for my order to find out they gave it to the wrong person and if I don't ask after getting off a call for an update no one cared to check in on me and ask what order I was waiting on. I ordered the café de olla iced coffee and not sure if it's because they rushed to make it but it was not good. Very disappointed,"Jun 2, 2025"
"Very small seating area but nicely decorated! Food was good and service was good! Place is small, however, prompting our early departure since the cooking area was too close for comfort.","Mar 22, 2025"
"Great coffee, service and vibes. I got the cafe de olla with cold foam and Iced abuelita latte. Both soo good, with some old school music playing in the back ground on a rainy day. This place hit the spot.","Nov 23, 2024"
"I've been going here ever since it opened. It's truly one of my favorite coffee shops. The workers are always so kind and welcoming and of course the drinks and food are yummyyyy. Everyone is so sweet , I love this coffee shop.","Apr 2, 2025"
"Like a few other low rating reviewers, I too had high hopes for this establishment. My concern is less about either or not it was trendy enough or if the concept aligned to the name of the establishment, but rather the overall absence of customer service.

My wife attempted to order a chocolate chip ice cream (which was prominently on display next to the cashier). The barista insisted that they didn't have chocolate chip, but rather mint. She claimed the flavor was pistachio. After going around in circles for a few minutes we begrudgingly paced an order for ""pistachio"". My family (next in line) ordered a different ice cream.

After waiting almost 20 minutes, we saw that someone scooped the wrong flavor(s) from mine and my families order. Root cause? Apparently we ordered pistachio... not CHOCOLATE CHIP... WHICH THEY HAD... because it was ON DISPLAY.

I get it, the cafe was hot, there was no air, it was busy, but do you have to be dismissive to guests when they place an order? Let along argue with a guest that's trying to help you out?

If anyone would like to reach out to this establishment to discuss other observations and my recommendations for improvement, please feel free to do so.","Aug 25, 2024"
Came to this place for the first time and it's a cute little shop and it was popping! I got a cafe de olla with cold foam very yummy. Took a little long but I didn't mind since I had time this morning overall good experience:),"Nov 8, 2024"
"Cute little spot in South Gate in an area with no similar businesses so that's a plus. I've you enter you get a warm greeting from the owner who treats you like family. She's incredibly sweet and checked in often enough in case there was something else you needed. I didn't wait long for my order either.

I ordered the lavender latte and the spicy chicken chipotle panini and both were delicious. The lavender latte was very earthy and the right amount of sweet. The doctor chipotle chicken sandwich was also really good. It wasn't spicy but that's okay.

The only drawback is that parking is rough but I found parking a couple blocks away and just walked over.","Mar 24, 2024"
"I had high hopes for Coffee and Chisme because the concept is cute, but honestly, it's just another TikTok trend that doesn't live up to the hype. I went on the weekend, and while it wasn't packed, which made ordering easy, they didn't even have the AC on.... It was so hot and uncomfortable in there that I instantly wanted to leave.

I ordered a white chocolate mocha iced coffee and a Mt. Everest crepe, and both were awful. The coffee was soooooo sweet and practically lukewarm the second they handed it to me--I couldn't even finish it and ended up tossing it out because it was that ...bad. The coffee was barely coffee, it was more milk and sugar than anything. The crepe was burnt and dry, like they need way more experience making them. It wasn't sweet at all, and the whipped cream was already melted by the time it got to me.

Honestly, avoid this TikTok trend of a place. It's not going to last with such poor quality. Save your money and skip it!","Aug 10, 2024"
"Coffee is Amazing as well as the customer service! I loved the banana muffin especially warmed up. I love the chisme lol and the fact you get to write and leave stuff as well, really nice place to come and gossip with friends!","Dec 11, 2024"
"It's a cute small coffee shop! I do wish there were more seats, but we got a table pretty quickly. I got a ham and cheese croissant which was decent, and their coffee was good! The chismes are pretty juicy too.","Oct 3, 2024"
"So good! The cinnamon latte is perfect! The abuelita one is on the sweet side so I would add another shot next time but was still amazing.

Inside- super cute, limited seating
Parking- free parking on the street
Both lattes- 8/10","Mar 25, 2024"
"Literally the best coffee spot in South Gate! Coffee is great, food is good, and customer service is excellent! Good vibes! Reasonable prices!","Feb 5, 2025"
"A cute lido Gem in South Gate. The place is a vibe the music was on point, and well let's just say chisminado con las comadres/bristas. 10/10 with their service.","Nov 14, 2024"
What a hidden gem! I was in the area and I'm so happy I came in. The drink is unique and you can read chisme while you sit. Really light hearted and cool concept. Service from Sam was amazing too. Will be back again!,"May 15, 2025"
"Excellent food, coffee, and service.
Definitely recommend a visit. We the Nutella crepe and it was delicious.","Aug 30, 2024"
Delicious iced cafe de olla for hot SELA summer days! Will definitely return. Loved the service.,"Aug 31, 2024"
"This place is great. It's a neighbor coffee shop, not sure what people are complaining about. Yes it's on a Main Street - and? Parking is not their problem. Delicious cafe de olla, and bagel. Chill music, outlets for working thank goodness! Sitting in the lobby reminded me of doing homework while my mom and tias cooked and shared chisme. lol 10/10 will be back.","Dec 16, 2024"
"I went in with a friend for a lil catch up and omg it was so cute and nice. Parking is kinda hard to find, we got lucky we found some on the street but other that that this is a very chill spot. I got a peaches & crème crepe & a matcha latte. As for service the girl behind the counter was extremely nice and gave my friend extra bananas for her crepe since they were almost out.

I definitely want to come back again and try the cocoa puff iced coffee.","Feb 14, 2025"
"I really loved the service, we were greeted immediately when we walked through the door. All the employees were very kind, charismatic, and patient when interacting with us. This establishment is bilingual as well and I absolutely loved their decor. The coffee was fresh and the crepes are made on the spot with fresh fruits. I loved that we could see everything being made. It's also very affordable in comparison to big chains, definitely a good spot to come catch up on some chisme. Excelente servicio, café delicioso, y lindo lugar.","Jul 13, 2024"
Staff is nice but they gotta figure out the POS system. Gotta level up and figure out how to use the technology as a tool.,"Nov 4, 2024"
"Ambiance is always nice!
And friendly customer service is a 10+, just what is needed after a long day","Nov 4, 2023"
"As soon as I walked in, Luz greeted me with great enthusiasm. I like to visit coffee shops to try their cafe de olla and this one is hands down one of the best in town. It's creamy, not too sweat, and you can capture the cinnamon aroma in the blend. Definitely a great ambience to catch up with friends or for some alone time to catch up on work! Luz made it feel like home, coming again soon!","Jul 17, 2024"
"The service is great, the cashier is really nice and so is everyone else. The specialty drinks are really good too, I really liked the cereal coffee. The portions are good for the prices in my opinion. The place has seating inside and outside. The place is a bit small though just a heads up, but it's nothing bad. It doesn't take away from the ambiance inside which is also pretty.","Aug 25, 2024"
"Love the name that they decide to go with which makes it fun and funny. Overall, the quality of shop is very clean.

I was able to speak to the owner Veronica who is very nice and uplifting. The coffee is good and worth a try especially being a local business which I'm a big fan of. I got the Horchata frappe and it was a right amount of sweetness.","Mar 18, 2023"
Cafe de Ola with sweet cream on top was AMAZING!!! I will most definitely be going back!,"Oct 28, 2024"
"This place is such a great hidden gem , they accommodate with all the orders you want they can make them low sugar to high sugar which i appreciate it a lot, the tuna bagel was delicious and the place looks very clean too which helps when an establishment is serving food. I will be definitely coming back","Nov 9, 2024"
"Really wanted to like this place. I just moved up the street and it popped up on my TikTok so I was thinking ""What luck!"" A cute local coffee shop.
I was definitely disappointed. The space is very tiny, so not a lot of room to hang out there. It was also extremely warm.
The staff were friendly, but it took over 30 mins to get my drink. I figured they were just understaffed, but when I finally got my iced cafe de olla, it tasted extremely watered down. Like a cafe de olla lacroix. I almost tossed it if I hadn't waited a half an hour for it.","Sep 18, 2024"
Great customer service! The owner was so sweet and accommodating. The cafe de holla iced was good along with the crepe!,"Sep 21, 2024"
"Buen servicio muy amable la gente, la comida es una delicia, chisme potente buena energía","Mar 12, 2025"
"The coffee is just as delicious as ever, but having been away for a while, I'm a tad let down by their service hours. It's a shame they're not catering to the working morning crowd, their hours the first few months were a little weird. 9am Is simply to late","Aug 8, 2023"
"Okay. To start off the place is really cute and aesthetic, i ordered an everything bagel with cream cheese and it was a solid 9/10.

now, my suggestions begin with the abuelita blend i ordered, i'm not much of a sweet tooth but i expected to taste more of creamy chocolate that you normally taste when you drink chocolate abuelita, although it's a blend i tasted the ice more than anything else, 5/10.

I also ordered the red velvet cupcake, it was good but pretty average, i expected the icing to be creamy but it tasted like those cheap jelly like icing's that you can get at walmart for a dollar, 2/10 not worth the money.

Overall Coffee and chisme is cute and aesthetic but the quality in food can be a bit better.","Dec 15, 2024"
I used to love coming here but they don't advise when out of product they'll charge you then tell you after the fact when they're out of something. I had to get my money back they gave me my money from the tip jar and only gave me what the drink was worth. They didn't return the two extra dollars they charged me between the substitution of milk and tax. Really disappointed.,"Jan 13, 2025"
"Really wanted to give this place a try as their coffee looks flavorful; however, it was difficult to find parking and once I did, I walked over and no one said anything to me as I waited a some time standing over the cashier. I understand it may have been busy for them, but it would've been nice to hear something like ""we'll be right with you"". I ended up leaving, but would love to give this place another try, maybe at a less busy time. Place was a bit on the warm side so definitely seems better to go later towards the night.","Oct 7, 2024"
"The ladies here are always so nice. The place is very roomy and has a nice vibe to it as well. I came here a couple times with my mom, and she loved their cafe de olla! I did too. I highly recommend the banana nut loaf. My boyfriend took me here for our first date last year here as well. It's a good place to come to if you like to chat and sip!","Oct 30, 2024"
"They have so many food options that are all so good!! The ladies here are always so so sweet and attentive!!
It is a small place but the inside is so cute and the plants make it feel homey!! I will always recommend this place","Apr 22, 2024"
"This truly is a great place for coffee and chisme. My best friend and I spent well over an hour catching up, and we felt comfortable enough to do so. All of the staff was kind, especially Liz, whom I assume is the owner. She was very attentive and especially kind to my son. Gracias por su atención. Pronto regresamos!","Apr 19, 2024"
"Delish, nice people, perfect for the people to just want to have an aesthetic time to feel good","Oct 16, 2024"
"Me and my Tía went this morning to go have a little morning together. I got a lavender coffee and she got a matcha along with a croissant sandwich and I got a panini. I don't ever make reviews but this place was so good and did not disappoint. The service was really good and felt very welcoming and appreciative, I would definitely recommend this place. The ambiance is pretty and has a little couch where it feels super nice. Definitely a 10/10 !","Apr 12, 2024"
"Great place to meet up with friends and literally chismiar! They have a cool chisme jar, you can read through them and the tea was good, food and coffee is pretty.","Jan 31, 2025"
"My favorite place to get coffee!! The food options and the vibes are great too; the chisme jar is always entertaining and the staff makes you feel so welcome. I always get lots of work done here, but also love stopping by just to grab my coffee on a slow morning!","Oct 8, 2024"
"I found this location through instagram, my friend and I came here yesterday for some coffee and it was delicious. Very cute how they have it set up inside, wish there was more seating. The receptionist after placing our order offered us the chisme jar and 10/10. We definitely come back","Mar 2, 2025"
"Here on Memorial day and it was empty and slow when came in at 10:15am, its now 11:03 am and have not received all of my order. Drinks and food are not labeled, leaving me guessing on which is which.

Dont think ill come back, sorry to the girl working hard. While the ""manager"" was just sitting down not helping much.","May 27, 2024"
"I don't do reviews, but I really enjoyed this place. The service was great and I had an Americano with a coffee cake. Both were great! Inside is small but looks nice. I sat and ate my cake, even though I wasn't planning on staying.","Oct 1, 2024"
"I'm a coffee girl and love to check out oval coffee shops when in other cities. I came across this place and thought I'd give it a try because the name got me. I walked in and was told I couldn't be inside because I had my dog (mind you she's 3 pounds)
I get it, some establishments don't allow dogs but it's rare. Considering the place didn't appear to clean, I was offended. There was outside seating which is typical if they don't allow dogs but the area in which I was in, I didn't feel safe and seats looked uncomfortable (no back support)","Nov 20, 2023"
I liked coming here. The service was pretty nice. They are very friendly. Didn't try their food but i did try the coffee. It was a solid 7/10 i tried their lucky charms and Cocoa Puffs coffee. They are basically the same but different cereal. The ambiance felt very homey.,"Aug 16, 2024"
The service was great. Small but cozy ambiance to enjoy a hot or cold drink with good company.,"Jul 16, 2024"
"Loved the atmosphere of the place, they had so many different things on the menu you definitely have to go more than once to try everything out. The service was great it's bilingual and welcoming. I love the chiste of why it's called coffee and chisme","Feb 6, 2025"
my first time here and it was so good !! the service is very friendly and welcoming as well (: got the iced lavender london fog sooo good !!,"Feb 5, 2025"
"The food was absolutely delicious, i got the pesto chicken sandwhich and the caramel frappe. The food we ordered came quick and there is absolutely nothing wrong to say about it. Ordering was very easy and the whole setup of this cafe/restaurant was very nice! Loved it so much I will deff come again :)","Jul 26, 2024"
Amazing customer service Luz is amazing very friendly and super attentive. The ham and cheese is amazing I am so picky with my ham and cheese sandwiches but definitely pass the test thank you for you amazing food crepes very good as well. Drinks most definitely.,"Aug 27, 2024"
"Nice little spot they got some pastries and ice cream, I really like their caramel frappe","Aug 4, 2024"
"I came here because it had several good reviews and was excited to try a new coffee spot. Sadly, the service was not very good. We waited for over an hour to receive a two coffees, a panini, and a croissant. On top of that, they did not put out the orders in chronological order. They skipped over us and put out orders for at least three people who ordered much later than us. I will not be coming back here again, it felt like I had wasted a good portion of my morning.","Mar 16, 2024"
Amazing food and drinks ! The baristas are amazing and friendly! The place feels cozy and welcoming.,"Jul 31, 2024"
"Unlike some people, I don't show up to a business 10-15 minutes BEFORE they open and then complain about them not being open. ‍

Let me tell you how much I love this place -- the decor, the comfortable seating, THE SERVICE!! I love coming here for their iced chai lattes and delicious paninis. I have a feeling that in these colder months the Earl Grey London Fog is going to keep me warm~ The bagels and scones are delicious too!

Coffee & Chisme will definitely be a staple during my work days for sure.

If you haven't tried them out already, you definitely should!","Nov 8, 2022"
"Stop by this morning to get some breakfast since i like support my small businesses. Business was closed. Why post their hours if they aren't going to honor them . I will stop by my Starbucks since I know they're open.. I've been here a few times and there don't always have everything under menu available
***maybe consider updating the time on the door because if you zoom in It clearly l states 6 am . Maybe look at ur business hours on the door before you say it says 7 am.","Nov 3, 2022"
We got the cafe de olla with cold foam and the abuelita frappe and they were both super yummy. As someone who is a huge coffee lover I was impressed the iced coffee was not too sweet and had great flavor. I recommend the banana nut muffin it was delicious! The jar or chismes was entertaining to read while we waited for our order as well. I didn't catch the name of the lady who took our order but she was so friendly and welcoming!,"Nov 12, 2024"
"So many options!! The whole menu sounds amazing, i had tje cocopuffs drink with extra chocolate and its soooo perfect, the pricing is definitely reasonable for what you get, vegan pastries as well, i had the red velvet cupcakes and the frosting was perfectly fitying to the muffin, ill be coming back to try the rest of the menu","Dec 9, 2024"
I love this place specially since it's so close to where I live lol. It's a small little coge spot but they do have good drinks and pastries even some ice cream. The staff is awesome I Totally recommend!,"Aug 13, 2024"
"Excellent service, great food and awesome ambiance. I loved everything but in particular their employee Luz who is such a great host. She is charismatic, very attentive, and efficient. Food and drinks were quickly prepared. It was a very pleasant visit. Will definitely visit again and hope to see Luz. She is so loving and joyful.","Apr 20, 2024"
Really delicious coffee! It's located on a big street so you might have to park around the corner but my iced dirty chai with oat milk was amazing! It was pretty empty so I ordered right away and went on my way. The ladies who were working were super nice. There's a lot of food choices but I took one star off because my butter croissant wasn't flakey and nice like I like it. It was fine though.,"Jan 8, 2023"
"Great and fun coffee shop! Has a neighborhood feel but a lot of coffee options, pastries and more. I had the cafe de olla cold brew. It was tasty. Will be back for sure!","Oct 6, 2023"
Took almost half hour for 2 drinks wouldn't really recommend honesty was really disappointing the Cocoa Puffs drink taste like cereal with water,"Sep 15, 2024"
"Watered down drinks I ordered Oreo frapp, horchata frapp, and abuelita chocolate frapp they taste like water never again!!!!!","Sep 14, 2024"
"This place is super cute and all the people are so nice! I was so excited to hear about a new coffee shop opening in South Gate since I love mom and pop shops!

I came on their opening day and they seemed busy they were already out of some items so I'm glad it seemed to be going well.

I ordered an iced vanilla latte and an iced chai latte and accidentally got a hot chai but I am so glad because I really liked it! I also ordered a cheese danish and an everything bagel. They were both good.

This shop offers sandwiches and crepes too which I'm excited to try. Really cute shop! The only problem is street parking may be hard to find.","Oct 22, 2022"
"Skip the Starbucks and come to Coffee and Chisme! I personally love how sweet their cafecito is. I've always enjoyed their white chocolate mocha hot and I prefer it over Starbucks' because it tends to be more on the bitter side. The owners have always been very welcoming, and efficient. Out of the three times I've been here, I've never had an issue getting my food and drinks in a timely manner. The sausage and bacon muffin fills me up, comes out warm, and tastes like it was made from home. The bun is soft , as opposed to other breakfast sandwiches where the English muffin is hard, and the bacon and sausage taste on point. It's the perfect way to start your morning no matter what you're going to do today! I love the decor with the white neon sign entitled Coffee and Chisme. There's plenty of seats for you and your friend to chismeando or to get your study on! Come and support this Latinx small business .","Feb 24, 2024"
"Everything bagel was good. Cinnamon toast coffee was mid-- really sweet. Took over 30 minutes to get my order though. Would benefit from hiring more employees, there was only 1 girl behind the counter.","Mar 4, 2024"
"I love the cozy vibes, its a little hole in the wall near my house and the food is delicious, the crepes are yummy, the coffees are some of the best I've had and their paninis are my favorite. I like that you can customize your items, they really do cater to their customers. I rather go here than starbucks. Luz is literally the nicest person she makes you feel welcomed and has great customer service, all around great place 10/10 recommend!","Jul 3, 2024"
The food was not worth the price the girl made the crepe so lazily it was watery and was basically just a pancake and the sandwich was charred and just tasted burnt it's only good when the senora is there she is super nice and puts a lot of effort into it and got it to us fast the girl put no effort and took super long,"Sep 10, 2024"
Gotta say for my fist time coming to this coffee shop I was amazed not only by the great customer service but how good and authentic the abuelita ice latte tasted. I will be coming back. Support your local small businesses.,"Jul 22, 2024"
"We were highly recommended coffee and chisme from a close friend. Since we were in the area, we just had to go here.
Cute establishment and love the idea of the chisme jar. The menu had plenty of options and as I am not a coffee or much of a caffeine drinker, I was immediately drawn to the thrifties ice cream. Being as chocolate chip is my absolute favorite, I saw they had it and knew I had to get it.

Line was a bit long which was fine since coffee spots like this tend to draw long lines and the air was uncomfortably hot inside. When it was our turn to order, I went first and asked for a scoop of chocolate chip ice cream. The young girl behind the counter said cookies and cream? And I repeated myself and said chocolate chip. She looked me straight in the eyes and said we don't have that. It's either cookies and cream or full chocolate. I let her know that there was chocolate chip in the ice cream freezer and that the tub was labeled chocolate chip. And she said she knows but it's not chocolate chip. I was taken back because it just seemed like she wanted to prove her point instead of ask me questions like ""oh can you show me?"" So me being frustrated said nevermind I don't want anything and stepped aside to let the rest of my family order.
My husband saw what happened and knew I was bothered by this and offered to try to still get it for me. Sweet man. When he ordered it, he walked over to the freezer and pointed to the chocolate chip and was told by the young girl that it was pastachio. And when my husband said the one next to it was pastachio ( we could clearly tell it's pistachio icecream) he was ""corrected"" and said it was mint icecream. He figured since she confirmed chocolate chip was called pistachio in her eyes, he ordered the ""pistachio"". My family ordered two pistachios(not knowing the young girl was confused by the icecream flavors). When it was time for her to scoop out icecream, she scooped 3 chocolate chip icecream. My sister in law pointed out to her that it's supposed to be pistachio and the girl told her that's what it is. I walked up and pointed to the chocolate chip and said it's chocolate chip and the next one is pistachio. One of the other employees I think heard a bit of what was going on and kindly stepped in. He advised to her she was scooping the wrong ice cream and was able to finish helping us out with the correct order.
So after a 20 minute wait, no apologies and terrible manners by the young lady who ran the cashier, this left a bad taste in our mouths. After the rest of my family tried their coffees, they were disappointed as well. 2/10 would not recommend. (The 2 is for the chisme jar idea)","Aug 25, 2024"
Order the spicy chicken chipotle panini and the ice cinnamon latte and thank me later . Service was also amazing 10/10,"Apr 11, 2024"
My husband and I came a week or so ago and absolutely loved it. There is so much I can say about this place and how amazing we were treated. The staff was truly incredible and our experience there was like no other. It's a cute little spot but it also has great personality. We hope to stop by soon! I also LOVE that it very pet friendly!! Thank you Luz for the experience!,"Sep 30, 2024"
"New coffee shop in South Gate. Beautiful and clean shop with very welcoming team. Got an iced dirty chai.

Lots of nondairy alternatives and a large coffee menu. Look forward to coming back.","Nov 6, 2022"
Customer service was great! The woman who took my order was so sweet. The iced vanilla latte along with the vegan brownie I ordered was so good!,"May 23, 2024"
"Service and ambiance is great. It's a little nook with a warm feel. We tried the hazelnut waffle & crepe, which were delicious except that next time I visit I'll order the hazelnut spread on the side.","Feb 28, 2024"

"Coffee & Chisme is the place to go for your Coffee and Chime needs! They are the BOMDIGGITY on the edge of Southgate. We had 4 strikeouts in coffee shops NOT selling Esperesso. The shop is CLEAN, the employees are SWEET and COURTEOUS.. The restroom is SPECTACULARLY clean! I HIGHLY recommend this for your MexiCali experience.","Jun 11, 2024"
Today was my first visit to this adorable coffee shop!!! I fully recommend going I purchased the lavender latte which was so good and the employees are so friendly. Wonderful place to study while enjoying a worm cup of coffee and the menu is catered to everyone from vegan to your sweet tooth.,"Mar 30, 2024"
I tried the cinnamon toast crunch iced coffee and it was good. The banana muffin was very flavorful . The chocolate croissant had a dark chocolate taste. The cafe the la olla iced coffee was great too. The ambiance was relaxing and clean. I love the decor. The service was as any other coffee shop.,"May 7, 2024"
I have been here twice and it is a little difficult to find parking since it is on a busy street but worth it! Their coffee is really good and the employees are really nice! It is a little hot inside but overall very nicely decorated and clean :),"Oct 27, 2024"
I loved the iced cafe de olla! Everyone was super friendly and quick with make our drinks.,"Sep 8, 2024"
Service is great and the food as well. Very cozy place and the ambience is just right. Need a bigger place but it's great. Chisme is also good lol,"Oct 15, 2024"
This is such a cute coffee shop. The seating is very limited but it is a great place to study and the coffee and treats I've tried so far are very good. There are outlets and wifi. They are busy but it is worth the wait.,"Apr 4, 2024"
"This is an adorable, cozy, and delish place... if searching for a refreshing drink try the lavender lemonade and the mojito mint lemonade...

If you are reminiscing on traditional abuelita try the chocolate abuelita latte ....will hit the spot

The service is great and friendly... you will enjoy the tranquility of the place...!","Apr 3, 2024"
"Great tasting coffee! We decided to try Coffee and Chisme out as it was a new spot very local to us.

The menu options are plentiful and the quality was great.

Their vanilla latte was on point. It had a nice balance of flavor and sweetness.

We will definitely be coming back to try out their crepes and waffles!","Dec 26, 2022"
"The barista was so nice, the cafe had a comfortable space for it being on the small side. I ordered the iced cafe latte and honestly the beans tasted burnt. My girlfriend had the coco puff iced coffee, if you order that wait a little bit for the cereal to really incorporate into the coffee","Jul 5, 2023"
I came to visit this quaint little shop over the weekend while visiting family. I was pleasantly surprised at this cute little shop. The ambiance was what you'd expect from going to a coffee shop on Abott Kinney in Santa Monica. The food and coffee was great as well. I ordered the strawberries and cream crepe and the cafe de olla. Love to support small businesses and this one made me happy to support knowing it is such an outstanding place in the middle of the hometown I grew up in. Definitely coming back next time I visit.,"May 24, 2023"
"I got an iced cafe de olla with oatmilk.
It tasted funky...like idk trapo sucio after taste.
The place was cute.
Parking sucked.
The lady was nice.
Will I come back? No.","Feb 25, 2023"
We got the chicken pesto panini and the mozzarella tomato basil panini. Both were really good and my friend enjoyed their coffee! We ordered pick up and they waited to make the drink so it'd be warm. But was still ready really fast,"Jul 9, 2024"
such a cute shop! the owner is so sweet as well. had the caramel frappe and it was delicious! only downside is parking but other than that its a neat place to visit with friends!,"Aug 16, 2024"
Came to this little spot had the best drink- dirty chai with oat milk and lavender it was so good. Ordered a tomato mozzarella pesto panini again so good!! Would definitely recommend this place. The service was excellent very friendly,"May 29, 2024"
"my sister ordered the crepe and chocolate abuelita and said both were delish i only tried the crepe and i can attest to it being very good !!
i ordered a ham and cheese croissant and a caramel macchiato and they were both so yummy. the croissant had both yellow and white cheese and the menu is not expensive at all in comparison to most breakfast cafes !","Jan 4, 2023"
I love this place! The workers are always so welcoming and so nice. Their white chocolate mocha is 10/10,"Aug 2, 2024"
First time here and truly enjoyed everything!

We also tried the paninis and a plain crepe and they were just so delicious! Forgot to takes pics since we were so hungry ... till next time. Ps great service :),"Feb 2, 2023"
Not sure what espresso beans they use but the flavor is smooth. The vanilla syrup is not too sweet either. I ordered a small iced vanilla latte and it was really good. I'll be back to try a cafe de olla.,"Oct 24, 2022"
"This place is wonderful! The staff is so nice and attentive. Super cute atmosphere. They had so many drink options that my friend and I each ordered two! We had the hibiscus tea, cucumber lemonade, raspberry lemonade, and an abuelita cold brew. Each drink was amazing! I also ordered the turkey sandwich and it was delicious and perfectly toasted. The noise level is also enough for you to hear the person you're talking to but also loud enough that no one will listen to your conversation. Perfect for the chisme. We sat talking for two hours. 10/10 will come again","Jul 15, 2024"
The coffee is great! I have a picky boyfriend when it comes down to taste and he prefers the frappes better than Starbucks haha,"Nov 7, 2023"
Super cute spot ! Had the Cinnamon Toast Crunch Iced Coffee and I was not expecting actual Cinnamon Toast Crunch in my iced coffee super good ! Service is great!,"Oct 24, 2022"
I was in the area and decided to try a new coffee place and I came in yesterday however I did not have the best experience. The young girl was taking my order and I witnessed another lady screaming at her in the middle of my order which made me uncomfortable. Not only that but i got my order about 30 minutes after ordering even though it was only 2 drinks.,"Jul 31, 2024"
"I ordered the cafe de olla iced and it was delicious. The menu has so many options for drinks and food, I can't wait to go back and try something else. The two women working here when I stopped by were very friendly. One of the women was taking a picture of a drink to post on social media and after taking their pictures they gave it to us for free to try it. I believe the drink was an iced strawberry matcha, It wasn't something I would have normally ordered but it was surprisingly delicious and very nice of them to do.","Mar 30, 2023"
one of my favorite places in all of Los Angeles to get coffee. Doesn't hurt that it's close to my parent's place either.,"Nov 15, 2023"
"No good at all, is that a crepe ? We want to support local businesses but....no goodddd !!!!!","Mar 20, 2023"

"i waited 45 mins for my coffee, just to realize they hadn't even started my order. when I finally got my coffee it was cold, it didn't have any creamer or sugar (how I ordered) and the whole time 3 employees were in the back just chatting. this place was really a let down.","Feb 10, 2024"

"First time trying and found their iced cafe de olla with oat milk to be delicious especially since it's been hot! I tried the tomato, mozzarella with turkey panini amazing. Second time in a couple of days and I ordered same coffee but this time went with pastries but they were a bit dry for my liking (coffee cake which owner said was popular and blueberry scone which was average). Next time I will try something else!","Jul 21, 2023"
"Disappointed and i didnt even try the coffee! Their hours state they are open M-F from 9-8pm. We went around 4pm and it was closed! Not to mention, parking is extremely limited so we struggled to park just for us to go to a different spot!","Sep 23, 2023"
Came here to try out the coffee and food. They were sweet ladies behind the counter however they failed to warn us that they were extremely backed up. It took over an hour for us to get our order. I think it's unfair to let people order without a proper warning. On top of that people who arrived after us got their food and drink before us. It seemed that whoever went up there to complain got their food/drink faster. We were trying not to be rude but after an hour it was frustrating to not even get our simple coffee orders. We finally got our order after an hour and half.,"Mar 16, 2024"
"So far I have tried the iced cafe de olla and the cold brew, definitely recommend both if you like cold coffee.","Apr 22, 2024"

"I order a turkey sandwich and a horchata frappe. All I said was no red onion and no bell pepper on my sandwich. I waited more than 15 minutes and the people that came after me got their orders before me. Once I got my sandwich I left without checking because I was almost late to my appointment. When I opened my sandwich I get is a turkey and cheese bagel. I checked my receipt to see if I had order correctly and I did. If all I was ""getting"" was a turkey and cheese sandwich why did it take more than 15 minutes for it.","Apr 29, 2023"
Nice little location. Luz helped me and she was very welcoming and sweet. Ordered the Nutella tropical crepe and an iced cafe de olla with cold foam. Both very delicious! Will be coming back,"Mar 18, 2024"

"so disappointed. it was such a cute shop and concept but the coffee tastes like sink water and no coffee taste. i got a coco puff iced latte and i was expecting the ""coffee"" itself to have some sort of coco puff flavor but it didn't and it didn't even taste like coffee. the pastries were pretty dry and stale not sure how long they were out for. they also messed up our order but the service was okay, couldn't hear anything over the loud music. sad to say that i won't be coming back.","Aug 23, 2024"
The food and service is great! I love their chicken chipotle and turkey panini both are delish. The drinks are good too! My son loves the horchata frappe and the pepperoni panini.,"May 18, 2023"
"The drinks and food are really good. The staff is wonderful and welcoming. The place looks so pretty and clean. When i went, one of their employees, Luz took my order. Best customer service!

Right down the street from me! Really cute place with tasty drinks. I'd recommend the horchata frappe.,"Oct 24, 2022"
The service and ambiance are amazing! The cafe de olla with almond milk was delicious. I came on a Friday afternoon and lots of street parking.,"May 5, 2023"

Found this place by chance need a place to stop at while waiting for my car. I love little coffee shops. Got a basic latte and a nutella tropical crepe had to substitute the strawberries with mango and wow was that yummy. The employees are nice. Glad I stopped by.,"Dec 23, 2022"
"This place is so cute and cozy great ambiance. I love that every time I come in they welcome you with a smile super nice service. Their Cafe De olla is so good one of my favorites, i recently tried their holiday drinks they where so delicious .

Amazing service very nice place to sit and eat the turkey panini is very good must try! Nice ambiance,"Feb 17, 2023"

"The cafe de olla was good but I can't say the same for the ham and cheese croissant that I ordered, it actually gave me a stomach ache. It is a cute little coffee spot I'd definitely be back for the drinks. So happy there's cute little family owned places like this opening up in the area soo much better than Starbucks.","May 18, 2023"

"Hi everyone, I'm Tanya, a college student who goes to CSULB. When going out with friends, I happen to go to an abundance of coffee shops and they are usually average. I appreciate them, but I usually wouldn't opt for them as my first choice. I'd been wanting to try out this coffee place since I heard about them on Instagram. I can honestly say, I wasn't disappointed by the service I got. I can feel that family vibe and it really feels like everything is made by love and passion. That's a big difference from the Starbucks down the street. The design of the place is also stellar. I really like what they've done with a place that maybe isn't too big, it's a nice, comfortable area to enjoy your drink and food of choice. I will say I came in the morning around 9am so there wasn't a ton of people, but I can see this place packed at later times in the day. I wish them the very best of luck in thriving as a small family owned shop!!","Nov 5, 2022"
"I was walking along and stumbled across this place. I thought the name was really cute so I decided to check it out. Turns out that they just opened yesterday! I was happy to support a new business and got the blended matcha latte which was really good, the perfect amount of sweetness. My friend got thrifty ice cream which was super cool to see at a coffee shop! Definitely recommend stopping by.","Oct 23, 2022"
"It's a surprisingly nice place, the service and food was good. I do wish there were items like ketchup or Jelly but seeing as they are just starting, pretty good start. Overall, it was a pretty good experience. I would recommend for a quick early morning breakfast and coffee.","Dec 13, 2022"
"Such a cute coffee shop with great coffee, specifically the cafe de olla. I'm so glad I stumbled upon this gem. They were very welcoming which made my experience there perfect","Nov 11, 2022"

"I'm sorry I don't usually make reviews but I have to for this place. I understand you are a small business that just opened up but did not have a hanging menu. I had to hurry and pick what I wanted since others wanted to see the menu too. I then saw they had an online menu. Ordered a croissant from there. The croissant online stated it would have tomato and onion. When I got my croissant, it was just ham and cheese. I ate half a slice and when I got to the other half, it had a hair in it. a curly hair. I have straight hair so I know it wasn't mine. I tried to stay positive but then I found a hair stuck to the wrapper with cheese. I couldn't eat it anymore. Ever since then when I think of this place , I have a bad taste in my mouth. I also ordered a coco puff ice coffee. It tasted like leftover milk when you eat the coco puffs. They put coco puffs on top of your drink. They were stale. This was a very bad experience. I do not recommend this place. I rather buy a drink and a food item from Starbucks.","Dec 3, 2022"
